# Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Speech-to-Text (STT) system built using OpenAI Whisper.
It is capable of transcribing audio files of any length without manual segmentation
or duration constraints.

The system supports both `.mp3` and `.wav` formats and is designed to handle
long-form audio efficiently while maintaining high transcription accuracy.
